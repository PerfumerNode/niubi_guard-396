```


A free, open-source defense system that protects GitHub maintainers from spam, harassment, and coordinated abuse.

Niubi Guard helps maintainers defend their repositories without hiding the policy. You choose the detection signals, users, allowlists, model, prompts, confidence threshold, and response actions. Dry-run is the default. Strong actions only happen when you configure them and run apply mode.

We built it because maintainers reported coordinated attacks: hostile Issues, repeated copy-paste accusations, and reputation-pressure campaigns. More maintainers are seeing the same pattern. Normal project promotion is allowed. Coordinated harassment is not.

> **Don't want to self-host?** Use the free hosted version at [niubistar.com/guard](https://www.niubistar.com/guard) — no configuration needed. The open-source version is continuously improved. Issues and feedback are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/PerfumerNode/niubi_guard-396/issues).

## What it does

**Transparent.** Every detection carries labels, matched keywords or usernames, AI confidence, reasons, evidence, and planned actions.

**User-controlled.** Delete, close, lock, block, and interaction-limit actions stay off until the maintainer explicitly enables them.

**AI-powered.** Use your own OpenAI-compatible model. Bring your own base URL, API key, model, prompt, and confidence threshold.

**Open source.** The defense logic, UI, CLI, configuration schema, and placeholder brand assets are available for maintainers to inspect and improve.

**Multilingual.** The first release supports English and 简体中文 in the web UI and documentation.


## Web UI

The UI is a product console and policy builder:

- GitHub token and repository list
- detection signals and username defense
- allow phrases and allow users
- OpenAI-compatible AI detection
- confidence threshold and prompt editing
- review-only or auto-plan mode
- dry-run or apply mode
- scan output with detection labels, reasons, AI confidence, and planned actions
- **Docs button** with a built-in operation manual (bilingual)

API keys are not stored by the app. The browser sends them only for the current scan request.

## AI Detection

Niubi Guard can scan your own Issues and comments with an OpenAI-compatible model. It is designed to detect semantic attacks that do not always contain obvious signals:

- malicious Issues
- bot-like reports
- coordinated harassment
- spam campaigns
- mass-mention abuse
- template-based copy-paste attacks

The adapter calls:

```text
POST {baseUrl}/chat/completions
```

The model must return strict JSON:

```json
{
  "malicious": true,
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "label": "fake_star_accusation",
  "reason": "The Issue repeats an accusation template without project-specific evidence.",
  "evidence": ["same allegation pattern", "no technical detail"]
}
```

By default, LLM detections are `review_only`. Switch to `auto_plan` only when you want high-confidence AI detections to create planned actions from your enabled policy.

## Configuration

Create `guard.config.json`:

```json
{
  "repositories": ["owner/repo"],
  "rules": {
    "keywords": ["spam template", "copy-paste", "mass mention", "repeated link"],
    "denyUsers": ["suspicious-login"],
    "allowPhrases": ["good-faith report", "security disclosure"],
    "allowUsers": ["trusted-maintainer"]
  },
  "scan": {
    "includeIssues": true,
    "includeComments": true,
    "state": "open",
    "since": null,
    "maxPages": 5
  },
  "llm": {
    "enabled": false,
    "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "apiKey": "",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "confidenceThreshold": 0.8,
    "reviewMode": "review_only",
    "systemPrompt": "You are Niubi Guard, a GitHub repository abuse detection classifier. Detect spam, harassment, coordinated attacks, and template-based abuse. Do not flag good-faith criticism or valid reports.",
    "userPromptTemplate": "Repository: {{repoFullName}}\nType: {{sourceType}}\nAuthor: {{actorLogin}}\nTitle: {{title}}\nBody:\n{{body}}"
  },
  "actions": {
    "deleteComments": false,
    "closeIssues": false,
    "lockIssues": false,
    "deleteIssues": false,
    "blockUsers": false,
    "setInteractionLimits": false
  },
  "interactionLimits": {
    "limit": "existing_users",
    "expiry": "one_month"
  }
}
```

Destructive actions are disabled by default. Maintainers can enable them per repository policy.

## CLI

Create a starter config:

```bash
niubi-guard init
```

Dry-run:

```bash
niubi-guard scan --config guard.config.json
```

Apply enabled actions:

```bash
niubi-guard scan --config guard.config.json --apply
```

Without `--apply`, Niubi Guard only prints detections and planned actions.

## Development

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm build
npm pack --dry-run
```


## Contributing

We welcome:

- attack samples
- false-positive samples
- prompt improvements
- model adapter improvements
- language translations
- UI and accessibility improvements
- GitHub App, GitHub Action, and self-hosted deployment ideas

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md), [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md), and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before opening issues or pull requests.

Niubi Guard is a defensive project. It does not provide growth services, manipulate metrics, or declare official truth. It gives maintainers a transparent risk detection and response system they can control.

## Roadmap

- `v0.1`: rule detection, AI detection, web UI, audit output, manual response
- `v0.2`: review queue, labels, false-positive management
- `v0.3`: threat fingerprints and community threat feed
- `v1.0`: GitHub App, GitHub Action, and self-hosted deployment
